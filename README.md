# Farmhouse Table and Benches

## Purpose 
This was the first major furniture build. The table will serve as the main dining table. One of the benches will remain at the table, and the other bench will serve as the coffee table in the connected living room area.

Ultimately, this piece of furniture will be moved outside when the deck and patio are built and replaced with a nicer hardwood trestle dining table and bench.

## Materials
A lot of rough lumber from Lowe's. The table top and bench tops were 2x8s and 2x10s milled down with the table saw and edge joined together with pocket holes and screws. The legs are 4x4s framed together with the stretchers using lap joints. 

For the finish work, oil-based Dark Walnut stain and Polyurethane were used. 

## Learning Goals
This project was about putting together the fundamentals of building a functional piece of furniture and finishing it to make it last.
